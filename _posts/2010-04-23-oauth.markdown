OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external apps request authorization to private details in your GitHub account without getting your password. All developers need to [register their application](http://github.com/account/applications/new) before getting started.

A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique Client ID and Client
Secret.  The Client Secret should not be shared.

## Web Application Flow

This is a description of the OAuth flow from 3rd party web sites.

1. Redirect users to a this link to request GitHub access.
    https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?
      client_id=...&
      redirect_uri=http://www.example.com/oauth_redirect
2. If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a code parameter. Exchange this for an access token:
    POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token?
      client_id=...&
      redirect_uri=http://www.example.com/oauth_redirect&
      client_secret=...&
      code=...

    RESPONSE:
    access_token=...
3. You have the access token, so now you can make requests on the user's behalf:
    GET https://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show?
      access_token=...

## Javascript/Desktop Flow

These flows are disabled for now...

## Redirect URLs

The `redirect_uri` parameter is optional.  If left out, GitHub will
redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth
Application settings.  If provided, the redirect URL must match the
callback URL's host.

    CALLBACK: http://foo.com
    GOOD: https://foo.com
    GOOD: http://foo.com/bar
    BAD:  http://foo:com:8080
    BAD:  http://bar.com

## Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need.  This will
be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

* (no scope) - public read-only access (includes user profile info, public repo info, and gists).
* `user` - DB read/write access to profile info only.
* `public_repo` - DB read/write access, and Git read access to public repos.
* `repo` - DB read/write access, and Git read access to public and private repos.
* `gist` - write access to gists.

Your application can request the scopes in the initial redirection.  You
can specify multiple scopes by separating them by a comma.

    https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?
      client_id=...&
      scope=user,public_repo
