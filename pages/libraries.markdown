[Dustin Sallings'][dustin] [py-github][py-github] project was the
first third-party implementation of the v1 API and is tracking the v2
API in a branch as new API endpoints are published.

### Ruby ###

The [github-control][github-control] library is currently doing work using the v1 API. 
The aim is to build a library which others can build on top of. 
It currently has features which need to be enabled on the v2 API as they were in pre-release when developed.
